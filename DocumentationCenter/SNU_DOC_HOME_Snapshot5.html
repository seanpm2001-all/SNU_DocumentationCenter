<H2>The .s_algo128p file</H2>
<p>The .s_algo128p file is a 128 bit SNU algorithm Python file. There are many of these files, each one acts as an algorithm for a certain type of content. When processing a video, normally there can be up to 10000 different algorithm files scanning at once.</p>
<p>For example, if someone were to upload an image or video of a dog, an algorithm file would have to notice this. It would then fully activate if true. It will then get info on what type of dog it, and more. You can go more into depth with this with the advanced sorting section.</p>
<p>The file uses Python syntax. A new algorithm file needs to be created for each media type, and needs to be constantly updated.</p>

<HR id="AdvancedSorting">
<H2>Advanced sorting</H2>
<p>SNU uses a very advanced sorting mechanism when content is put on the site. The site has to gather as much info as possible for every pixel of content. An advanced and efficient sorting process is put into place.</p>

<H2>What is a documentation update</H2>
<p>A documentation update is an update to the website that is done to keep development active on a daily basis. Very basic documentation updates include only updating the update and developer logs, which adds very little to the site.</p>
<p>An update is no longer considered just a documentation update if a feature is updated that isn't purely for documentation. Some documentation updates are good, and they can be used for Sean to quickly make an update to keep the site active, but they shouldn't be the only update released, however there have been issues in the past regarding this, including a long period of documentation updates during the end of the 3.0.4 development phase, waiting to add features for 3.0.5</p>
<p><b>CONTENT MISSING</b></p>
<!--!-->
<HR id="UpdateSchedule">
<H2>Update schedule</H2>
<p>Sean has been working on SNU all by himself for a few years now. Starting in December 2017, it was written in Google sites, but SNU wasn't there for a while. The Google Sites version was eventually abandoned. In late 2018, a horribly made JavaScript version was made, but was not functional. It was simply taking notes.</p>
<p>However, the biggest change happened in January of 2019. While experimenting with HTML hyperlinks, Sean found out how to link between files. This led to HTML discovery and learning, and the first versions of SNU 3 were created. Over time, this came to be the biggest release of SNU to date. Many many improvements were made, and the concept was heavily tweaked.</p>
<p>With SNU 3.0, 3.0.1, 3.0.2, and 3.0.3, development was at random. Experiments were made daily, and features were tested until Sean moved on. Starting with version 3.0.4, updates were slowed down, with major releases coming less frequently, the current branch would be worked on. Sean tried to keep development going on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Starting with SNU 3.0.5, the site changed to a twice a year release model. The first version would be released on June 14th xxxx and the second version would be released on December 14th xxxx. The December 2019 update has not yet occurred, but the schedule is still solid.</p>
<p>This is done to prevent lots of memory being used for updates. A major site update is a copy of the site directory, and starting with 3.0.5, a major change was incorporated with each major update. Within each update, there are daily updates. An update is defined as when a file is created or modified. For example, if a snapshot was created, that snapshot alone counts as an update, while the page modifications count as 1 update separately.</p>
<p>Updates are created on a daily basis, with new changes daily. If a feature fails to be added, a documentation update is created instead to keep development active.</p>

<p>How SNU improves over YouTube</p>
<p>YouTube has had issues for a long time. These issues keep getting worse. It started getting really bad in 2014, and it continued to get worse really fast.</p>
<p>Googles method for managing YouTube is extremely bad. There are so many flaws with how they handle the site that I can't list them all right now.</p>
<p>Here are just some of these types of improvements.</p>
<p><b>SNU will not let the claimant of a video take any money from you, or let them claim the video/image/song at all.</b></p>
<p>One huge flaw in YouTubes monopoly is when a company claims a video, they can put ads on it, which is money for them, and not for you. They can even do this when you aren't eligable for monetization.</p>
<p>The scummy thing is that a video can be claimed for a ridiculously small amount of footage, for example, humming a theme song of a video game or TV show for a few seconds (even in a 2 hour video) can result in the video being claimed or taken down.</p>
<p>This is honestly really unfair, and SNU is not going to let this happen.</p>

<p id="ServerServerServer">11: Servers, subservers, superservers, and megaservers</p>
<p>Brief summary</p>
<p>SNU is not just a single server. There is a lot that goes into SNU, and the term "server" doesn't just refer to the main server.</p>
<p>The main server is a superserver, it hosts the main content by the main SNU team. Within the superserver, there are subservers. A subserver example would be the VoIP service. Users can create their own subservers in the superserver.</p>
<p>The Megaserver is the grand scheme of all SNU servers around the known universe together. When you download the SNU server software, you are hosting a secondary superserver within the megaserver.</p>
<HR id="StartingAServer">
<p>Starting a server</p>
<p>For a user to start their own SNU server, they are going to need to download a stable version of the site, along with the server essentials tool kit. Once downloaded, make sure you have a dedicated machine ready to run the server. It is recommended to have at least ??? Gigabytes of RAM to run the server, and a very strong internet connection (??.1 Gigabits or more) or else the server might go down due to massive amounts of activity.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to not use Windows 10 to run the server. Linux is recommended. The server essentials folder contains important tools for starting your server. You should first run the compression/extraction tool to choose the correct update, then you should use the server setup tool, and set up the server. Properly set up the server

<H2 id="MalwareJokeProgram">12: Malware joke program</H2>
<p>Brief summary</p>
<p>On August 23rd 2019, Sean made a joke page where you can "download" RAM for free. This page started out as just a joke, but I decided to start a series of pages that will both work as a joke, and also inform people about staying safe on the internet. This process reduces the number of malicious software that is downloaded.</p>

<HR id="TheDownloadMoreRAMPage">
<p>The download more RAM page</p>
<p>The download more RAM page is a SNU joke page created on August 23rd 2019 where a user can download RAM for free. This is a joke page, it is not possible to download RAM. What instead you are downloading are 1 megabyte goat files.</p>
<p>The joke is topped off with comic sans, poor use of punctuation, and fake reviews. It was realized in development that these pages can also serve the purpose of preventing inexperienced netizens from going to malicious sites.</p>
<p>More pages are in the works, but none were created the next day (August 24th 2019)</p>

<H2 id="SecuritySection">13: Site security</H2>
<p>Brief summary</p>
<p>The security of SNU is vital. We can't have servers getting compromised, systems being abused, or lives affected by compromising accounts. Several security techniques are going to be put into place to make sure the SNU ecosystem is strong. Someday in the future, possibly unhackable</p>
<p>If you are going to hack the site to test its security, we strongly support this, however please tell us first. Every time the server is attacked, another vulnerability will be patched, and if it is attacked enough, it could become undestructable.</p>

<HR id="SQLSecurityMethods">
<p>SQL security methods</p>
<p>SNU uses SQL for searches. However, there is a risk of an SQL injection attack if not properly programmed.</p>
<p>On August 25th 2019, Sean realized something. Most SQL injection attacks confuse the server into logging into the first account on the site. SNU accounts don't use SQL, but some sections of the site may allow it. The idea that he came up with is that if they were able to break into the first account, instead of patching it, the first account would be a locked account that lets you view the site, but nothing else. No other interaction.</p>
<p>SQL security flaws will be patched quickly once found.</p>
