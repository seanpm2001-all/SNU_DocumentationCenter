Idea board message

streak ended, no ideas today.
The streak lasted 50 days (from April 25th 2019 to June 13th 2019) and a lot of significant ideas were added to the website. We aren't stopping with this, we are just taking a little break.

Still on break. Ideas take time. Come back another day.
